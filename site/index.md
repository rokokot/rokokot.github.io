## Robin Kokot

I am a graduate student at the Faculty of Engineering Science at KU Leuven. I work on NLP, Language Engineering, and LLM interpretability. My recent research explores topics in multilingual alignment (RAI) and computational modelling of non-verbal communication.

## Research Interests

- Natural Language Processing
- Language Engineering
- Computational Linguistics
- NLP for non-written languages
- Explainable and Responsible AI

I am currently researching cross-lingual multimodal language understanding, focusing on how AI systems interpret and process linguistic cues across different languages and communication media (symbols, images, and gestures).

## Research

Some of my current research:

### Question Type and Linguistic Complexity Signals

TBA.

### PictoNMT: Multimodal Machine Translation for AAC Picto-to-Text Conversion

TBA.

### Interpretable AI

We're creating new methods to better understand and explain the decisions made by complex machine learning models.
