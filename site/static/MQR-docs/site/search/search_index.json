In this research project, we develop a framework for quantifying question complexity in a cross-lingual system setting. We begin by adressing a significant lack of unified approaches to computational modelling of linguistic complexity measures, as well as the lack of research investigating language agnostic features of information seeking linguistic structures (questions). By investigating how sentence complexity affects model performance across languages, our work contributes to the growing field of multilingual NLP evaluation, and develops a set of resources that can improve practical NLP system development.</p>"},{"location":"data/data_overview/","title":"Question Type and Complexity (QTC) Dataset","text":""},{"location":"data/data_overview/#dataset-overview","title":"Dataset Overview","text":"<p>The Question Type and Complexity (QTC) dataset is a comprehensive resource for linguistics/NLP research focusing on question classification and linguistic complexity analysis across multiple languages.
