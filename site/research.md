- Transfer learning and domain adaptation

## Current Projects

### Question Type and Linguistic Complexity Signals
**2024 - Present**

This project focuses on analyzing patterns in question structures across languages and how linguistic complexity affects comprehension and response generation.

### PictoNMT: Multimodal Picto-to-Text Machine Translation
**2025 - Present**

This project explores novel techniques for translating pictographic communication systems into natural language text, with applications for assistive technology.
